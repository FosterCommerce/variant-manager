# Overview

The goal of Variant Manager is to make managing a complex product catalog easier in Craft Commerce. Although Craft
Commerce offers a system to manually input the data for products and their many variants, it can become quite cumbersome
when dealing with a catalog of products that have many variations based on multiple options.

A common method to manage product catalogs for businesses is to use a spreadsheet to keep track of things like
stock, SKU's, prices, and the various options that are included for each item. So rather than trying to
shoe-horn product managers into using Craft Commerce's manual method of data entry for product variants, Variant Manager
embraces the spreadsheet approach, allowing you to import and export your product variants directly from your
spreadsheet via a CSV file.
