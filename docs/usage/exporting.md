# Exporting Products and Variants from Craft Commerce

If you need to update a product's variant data already in Commerce, an easy way to do this is to export the data with
Variant Manager as a CSV file, open it in your spreadsheet program to make any edits and then
[import it with Variant Manager](importing.md) again back into Commerce.

To export a product's variant data and attributes, go to the product's entry form in Commerce and in the right-hand
column on the bottom there is an "Export Product" button.

Click it, and Variant Manager will generate a CSV file of the current product's variant data and it will download
automatically to your computer.
